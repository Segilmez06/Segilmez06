- **C#**: Started journey with .Net platform. Spent long time with Windows development including P/Invoke and system internals.
- **C/C++**: Used for embedded development. My primary language as of last few years.
- **Python**: More than 8 years of time spent in Python. My most used (as in time spend writing code) programming language. Mostly for first and quick prototyping systems and using as a step to start development.
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Using bare web technologies, designed many pages for different purposes including (but not limited to) my own webpage.

### Tools and Platforms

- **Embedded Ecosystem**: STM32Cube (HAL, CubeMX, IDE), PlatformIO, Arduino, .Net nanoFramework
- **Build Systems**: GCC, CMake, GNU Make
- **Virtualization & DevOps**: Docker, Podman, Distrobox for environment isolation and deployment.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for collaborative development and CI/CD via GitHub Actions.
- **Desktop Development**: WinForms, WPF, NuGet, Electron
- **Home Automation**: Home Assistant, ESPHome, NodeRed

<!-- - **.Net platform and related tools**: WinForms, WPF, NuGet, nanoFramework, Cosmos Development Kit, WebView
- **NodeJS, Cordova, Electron**: Has a brief time period that I developed mobile friendly apps and packaged them with Cordova. Packaged web apps with Electron.
- **GCC, CMake, GNU Make**: Actively using these tools during my continuous embedded development cycle.
- **STM32Cube Framework**: I actively utilize ST Microelectronics' official tools, HAL and generators on my projects.
- **Docker, Podman, Distrobox**: Using containerization tools both on my daily systems for application environment virtualization and quick deployment from recipes.
- **Git and GitHub**: Actively contributing to open source projects and using for version control and collabrative development for projects that I maintain. -->
